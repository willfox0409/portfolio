      - I grew up across six countries — from Texas to Nigeria, then England, France and Brazil — a background that taught me to adapt, listen deeply, and build genuine connections, no matter the setting. Through all the change, music remained my constant! For over a decade, I’ve fostered a rich musical life — writing, performing, and releasing original songs, teaching guitar and songwriting, and building community through collaboration and mentorship of emerging songwriters.

      - Outside of music, I’ve spent years working in the service industry and, more recently, managing custom projects at a sustainable urban lumberyard in Los Angeles. Those roles taught me how to stay grounded under pressure, move fluidly across disciplines, and approach every task with care — never losing sight of the human side of the work. Whether I was stepping in to wash dishes, making an irreversible cut, or managing the installation of a two-ton log bench, I learned to show up fully, no matter the scale.

      - Now, as a full-stack software developer, I bring that same sense of care, creativity, and collaboration to the products I help build. I’m drawn to mission-driven work, and I believe that great tech — like great art — has the power to improve lives, spark joy, and bring people together.
