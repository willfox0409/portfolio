      - I grew up across six countries — from Texas to Nigeria, France to Brazil — an experience that shaped my ability to adapt, listen deeply, and build genuine connections in all kinds of environments. Throughout it all, music was my constant. For over a decade, I’ve written, recorded, and performed original songs, building community through live shows, workshops, and collaboration.

      - Outside of music, I’ve spent years working in the service industry and, more recently, managing custom projects at a sustainable urban lumberyard in Los Angeles. Those roles taught me how to stay grounded under pressure, move fluidly across disciplines, and approach every task with care — always keeping people at the center of the process. Whether I was stepping in to wash dishes, making an irreversible cut, or managing the installation of a two-ton log bench, I learned to show up fully, no matter the scale.

      - Now, as a full-stack software developer, I bring that same sense of care, creativity, and collaboration to the products I help build. I’m drawn to mission-driven work, and I believe that great tech — like great art — has the power to improve lives, spark joy, and bring people together.
